<p>JCSUnity is a component driven Framework built to allow the user <br />
to quickly generate commonly used game mechanics and features such <br />
as UI functionality and player movement. This will allow for a <br />
faster initial development. Most components work individually <br />
while other components must be used in tandem with others. <br />
Individually components can be combined to create new behaviors.</p>
